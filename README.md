# Landing Page

This is a custom Contentful app built with Vite and React that allows content editors to visually build landing pages using drag-and-drop blocks like Hero, Two Column, and Image Grid.

The layout is stored in a Contentful field (`layoutConfig`) and automatically synced using Redux and autosave middleware. A preview button opens the generated landing page on a deployed Next.js site using the page slug.

The app is designed to streamline visual content editing without needing to write code.

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

Before running the landing page repository locally, make sure to create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<your_space_id>
CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=<your_delivery_token>
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual Contentful credentials. This is necessary to fetch and render content from your Contentful space.
